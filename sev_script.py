            Dylan gave a eulogy. It was‚Ä¶ surprisingly touching.

            At the Outdoor Retreat and Team-Building Occurrence (ORTBO), **Helly's outie (Helena) and I shared vessels** which means we had sex.

            Instead, she told me that she wanted to **make memories of her own**‚Äîones that belonged to her, not Helena.
            So the two of us found an empty office space, pulled down the plastic wrapping covering the vacant desks,
